By: catherine rice

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneoulsy and allows you to keep track of changes made to files.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is an offshoot of the main project which you can download onto one computer and make changes to, without effecting the master branch (or the main part of the code).
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is when you save changes to a file to the repository. A commit message is a description of the changes/updates which other coders can understand.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when more than one person makes changes to the same file and it is unclear which version is the correct version, or when the code in your branch and the code in the branch you are committing to have discrepancies.
