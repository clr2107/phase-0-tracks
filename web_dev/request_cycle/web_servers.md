Web Servers
#1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
A Linux-based system is a modular Unix-like operating system which gets much of its design principles
from Unix design from the 1970's and 1980's. The system uses a monolithic kernel, the Linux kernel,
which handles process control, networking, access to the peripherals, and file systems. A monolithic kernel is an
operating system architecture where the entire system is working in kernel space and is alone in 
supervisor mode. Peripherals are ancillary devices used to put information into and get information out of the computer.
Three types of peripherals are input devices, output devices, and devices that perform both functions.
#2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of 
using a VPS?
A VPS (virtual private server) is a virtual machine (emulation of a computer system) which is sold by an internet
hosting service. It runs its own copy of an operating system (OS) and customers have 
superuser-level access to that operating system instance and so can install almost any software that runs on that OS.

#3: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
