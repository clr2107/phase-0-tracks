It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

##Different jQuery Events
Different jQuery events include: jQuery click(), jQuery dblclick(), mouseenter(), mouseleave(), mousedown(), hover(). You can use these with selectors, such as #("p").hide(). Other events are fade, toggle, animate, stop animations, HTML get and set content and attribues, traversing ancestors and descendants, etc.

##Basic jQuery syntax is:
###*$(selector).action()*
* The $ sign defines/accesses jQuery
* A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
