#Instructions: One user will enter a word and the other user attempts to guess the word.
#For now, set word equal to something. Use gets.chomp to get user input of a guess. 

#Instructions: Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the length of the word.
#Number of guesses equals length of word times 2. Add counter for every guess. If counter == word.length * 2, the user lost and game is over.

#Instructions: Repeated guesses do not count against the user.
#Somehow store all of the guesses, and if one is repeated, output error message and do not add to counter?

#Instructions: The word in its current state is printed after every guess. (i.e. if the word is “unicorn” the word will be “_ _ _ _ _ _ _” at the beginning, after the guess of “c” would be “_ _ _ c _ _ _ “.
#Word at the beginning should be an empty array []. Maybe for each letter there is an underscore. Word.length * “_” so “cat” would be [“_”, “_”, “_”] at the beginning.

#Instructions: The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.
#If word.include?(letter), puts “Congratulations! You guessed a correct word.” Then print current state of word.
#Else, puts “Sorry, guess again!” And print current state of word.
#Use a loop for the whole game? Until word = user_guess, ask for a letter.
