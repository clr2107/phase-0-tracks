What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to help with creating standardizaition between development teams and making pages more readable and accessible to people with disabilities. I think a lot of tags are useful, such as <section>, <aside>, <footer>, and <header>.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser displays elements top to bottom, left to right.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned how to make a snippet and how it can be very useful to have snippets for long sections of code used over and over. I think it would be handy to make a table snippet, so I can have a template of rows and columns ready.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I am still a bit unclear on how some semantic tags are used, but I think that will be clarified once I start employing them in my code. It's hard to understand how they are used solely from a definition.
